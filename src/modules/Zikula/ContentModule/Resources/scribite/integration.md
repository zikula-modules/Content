# SCRIBITE INTEGRATION

It is easy to include ZikulaContentModule in your [Scribite editors](https://github.com/zikula-modules/Scribite/).
ZikulaContentModule contains already a popup for selecting pages and other items.
Please note that Scribite 6.0+ is required for this.

To activate the popup for the editor of your choice (currently supported: CKEditor, Quill, Summernote, TinyMCE)
you only need to add the plugin to the list of extra plugins in the editor configuration.
