UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS:
    1) Before upgrading, please make a backup of the old module files and database tables, 
    since there are changes to the database. The upgrade process has been tested, 
    but Content is a complex module, so better be safe than sorry.
    2) After backup you can just run the upgrade to the new version and the database tables 
    will be updated and new variables will be automatically added.
